# Aquarium-Fishes-Jellyfishes-

An aquarium app that has done in Java as studying project. As user of the app you can add fishes or jellyfihses in the aquarium, buy the adding you can choose size, color, speed of the animal. Also you can give them food - Worm if fish ate the worm its can grow up by the size, you can whatch the statistics of the animals. In this project I have implemnted a few Design Patterns like: Singletone, Abstract Factory Method, Decorator, Memento, Prototype, State and Listener(Observer). Also in this project I have used a concurrency methods to work with Threds.

To tun the programm you have to download Java IDE. Then copy all files in the IDE and run them.
